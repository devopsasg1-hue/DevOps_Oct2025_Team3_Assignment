Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/DevOps_Oct2025_Team3_Assignment.git
cd DevOps_Oct2025_Team3_Assignment
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm ci

# Backend
cd ../backend
npm ci
```

### Environment Setup

Create `backend/.env`:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
PORT=3000
```

Create `frontend/.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Running Locally

Start backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Start frontend (in another terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`

---

## Docker

Build images:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
docker build -t devsecops-backend .

# Frontend
cd frontend
docker build -t devsecops-frontend .
```

Run containers:
```bash
# Backend
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file backend/.env devsecops-backend

# Frontend
docker run -p 5173:5173 devsecops-frontend
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 39 total tests
- 83% controller coverage
- 90% middleware coverage
- 60% overall coverage

**Test Suites:**
- `authController.test.js` - Authentication endpoints
- `adminController.test.js` - Admin operations
- `fileController.test.js` - File management
- `authMiddleware.test.js` - JWT verification
- `integration.test.js` - End-to-end API flows
- `security.test.js` - SQL injection, XSS, access control

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflows

**build-client.yml** (runs on PR to main)
1. Security checks - npm audit for vulnerabilities
2. Build - install deps and build frontend
3. Email notification with status

**security-scan.yml** (runs on PR and push to main)
1. SAST scanning with Semgrep
2. SCA scanning with npm audit (frontend + backend)
3. Secret scanning with TruffleHog
4. Dependency review
5. Email notification with results

### Branch Protection

The `main` branch requires:
- Pull request reviews
- Passing CI/CD checks (build-client + security-scan)
- Up-to-date branches
- No direct pushes allowed

### Email Notifications

Automated emails sent to stakeholders after each workflow run:
- Workflow status (PASS/FAIL)
- Job results summary
- GitHub Actions run link

Configured via GitHub Secrets:
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`
- `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO`

---

## Security

### Application Security

- JWT token authentication
- bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (user vs admin)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Data isolation (users only see their own files)
- Environment variable protection

### Pipeline Security

- SAST scanning (Semgrep) for code vulnerabilities
- SCA scanning (npm audit) for dependency CVEs
- Secret scanning (TruffleHog) for exposed credentials
- Security gates - deployment blocked if scans fail
- Branch protection enforcement

### Database Security

- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete
- Indexed columns for performance
- Separation of auth and profile data
- Row-level security via Supabase

---

## Deployment

**Frontend:** Deployed to Cloudflare Pages  
**Backend:** Deployed to Render  
**Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Frontend auto-deploys on merge to `main`. Backend is configured for auto-deployment on Render.

---

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "feat: add feature"`
3. Push: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
4. Create Pull Request on GitHub
5. Wait for CI/CD checks to pass
6. Get PR review approval
7. Merge to main

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`

---

## GitHub Secrets Setup

Required secrets for CI/CD:

**Supabase:**
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET`

**Email Notifications:**
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `EMAIL_FROM`
- `EMAIL_TO`

Add these in: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
